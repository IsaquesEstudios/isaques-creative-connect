> **Attached via file-copy.** This design system's source lives at `@/design-system/the-reading-room-697922/`. Peer-dependency version requirements still apply: if the consumer's stack differs (Tailwind major, React major, etc.), migrate it to match before relying on these components.

# The Reading Room — Guidelines

## Components

The design system exports these components — import them from `@/design-system/the-reading-room-697922` and compose them before building anything from scratch:

`Accordion`, `AvatarStack`, `Badge`, `Button`, `CardDescription`, `CardTitle`, `Card`, `DisplayHeading`, `Footer`, `Highlight`, `IconButton`, `Input`, `Label`, `LogoCloud`, `MediaCard`, `Navbar`, `PricingCard`, `SectionHeader`, `ServiceCard`, `StatCard`, `Textarea`

Per-component details (import stanzas, props, variants, examples) live in `.lovable/rules/libraries/the-reading-room-697922/components.md` — on disk, not auto-loaded. Read that file or the component source when the name alone isn't enough.

## Theme Files

The design system's theme is delivered through the following files. The author's original source files carry the full wiring the design system needs — variable declarations, framework-specific directives, provider objects, etc. — and are the canonical import target.

- `@ws-e0239b415e137675b698/69be04c7-ac9a-403e-b35f-36ac87d20b6a/styles.css` (source — preferred import)
- `@ws-e0239b415e137675b698/69be04c7-ac9a-403e-b35f-36ac87d20b6a/dist/tokens.css` (auto-generated flat list of CSS custom properties — a raw-values fallback only; does NOT carry framework-specific wiring that the source files above provide)
